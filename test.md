**Measuring membrane-substrate adhesion energy from images of adhering vesicles**

In contact with an adhesive substrate, soft vesicles will deform to maximize the adhesion area. The balance between adhesion energy, membrane bending rigidity and the vesicle volume and surface constrains determines the shape of the adhering vesicle. Thus measurements of the shape of an adhering vesicle can be used to approximate the membrane-substrate adhesion energy which is usually not known.  Experimentally the method is based on fluorescence confocal imaging of adhering GUVs. Details of the method are given in the references(1,2) which should be read first. In the following the application and image analysis tools used are described. 


Naturally the imaging quality and resolution will determine the accuracy of the method and should be optimized first. It is advantageous to use a high NA water Immersion lense to limit spherical aberrations and achieve high resolution.
